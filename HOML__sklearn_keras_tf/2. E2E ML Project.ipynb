    "        * $h$ = Prediction function, also called a **hypothesis**.\n",
    "            * When your system is given an instance’s feature vector $x^i$, it outputs a predicted value $\\hat{y}^i\\ =\\ h(x^i)$.\n",

    "* Both the RMSE and the MAE are ways to measure the distance between two vectors: the vector of predictions and the vector of target values. Various distance measures, or norms, are possible:\n",
    "    * Computing the root of a sum of squares (RMSE) corresponds to the Euclidean norm: this is the notion of distance we are all familiar with\n",
    "        * Also called the $l_2\\ norm$, noted $||.||_2$ or just $||.||$\n",
    "    * Computing the sum of absolutes (MAE) corresponds to the $l_1\\ norm$, noted $||.||_1$\n",

    "    * This is why the RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than the MAE. But when outliers are exponentially rare (like in a bell-shaped curve), the RMSE performs very well and is generally preferred."
