    "# A. Example Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analyzing images of products on a production line to automatically classify them:\n",
    "    * Image classification, typically performed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or sometimes transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detecting tumors in brain scans:\n",
    "    * This is semantic image segmentation, where each pixel in the image is classified (to determine the exact location and shape of tumors), typically using CNNs or transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automatically classifying news articles:\n",
    "    * NLP --> text classification, w/c can be tackled using recurrent neutral networks (RNNs) and CNNs, but transformers work even better.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automatically flagging offensive comments on discussion forums:\n",
    "    * This is also text classification, using the same NLP tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Summarizing long documents automatically:\n",
    "    * This is a branch of NLP called text summarization, again using the same tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating a chatbot or a personal assistant:\n",
    "    * This involves many NLP components, including natural language understanding (NLU) and question-answering modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Forecasting your company’s revenue next year, based on many performance metrics:\n",
    "    * This is a regression task (i.e., predicting values) that may be tackled using any regression model, such as a linear regression or polynomial regression model, a regression support vector machine, a regression random forest, or an\n",
    "artificial neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Making your app react to voice commands:\n",
    "    * This is speech recognition, which requires processing audio samples: since they are long and complex sequences, they are typically processed using RNNs, CNNs, or transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detecting credit card fraud:\n",
    "    * This is anomaly detection, which can be tackled using isolation forests, Gaussian mixture models or autoencoders.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Segmenting clients based on their purchases so that you can design a different marketing strategy for each segment:\n",
    "    * This is clustering, which can be achieved using k-means, DBSCAN, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "* Representing a complex, high-dimensional dataset in a clear and insightful diagram:\n",
    "    * This is data visualization, often involving dimensionality reduction techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recommending a product that a client may be interested in, based on past purchases:\n",
    "    * Recommender System\n",
    "    * One approach is to feed past purchases (and other information about the client) to an artificial neural network, and get it to output the most likely next purchase. This neural net would typically be trained on past sequences of purchases across all clients. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Building an intelligent bot for a game\n",
    "    * This is often tackled using reinforcement learning"

    "### B.1. Batch Versus Online Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Batch learning:\n",
    "    * The system is incapable of learning incrementally, it must be trained using all the available data.\n",
    "    * The system is trained, and then it is launched into production and runs without learning anymore; it just applies what it has learned (**Offline Learning**).\n",
    "    * Unfortunately, a model’s performance tends to decay slowly over time, simply because the world continues to evolve while the model remains unchanged (**model rot or data drift**).\n",
    "        * The solution is to regularly retrain the model on up-to-date data.\n",
    "        * The frequency of training depends on the use case:\n",
    "            * If the model classifies pictures of cats and dogs, its performance will decay very slowly, but if the model deals with fast-evolving systems, for example making predictions on the financial market, then it is likely to decay quite fast.\n",
    "    * For a batch learning system to knwo about new data, you need to train a new version of the system from scratch on the full dataset (old + new) then replace the model w/ a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Online Learning:\n",
    "    * The system is trained by incrementally feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or in small groups called mini-batches.\n",
    "    * Useful for systems that need to adapt to change extremely rapidly.\n",
    "    * It is also a good option if you have limited computing resources; for example, if the model is trained on a mobile device.\n",
    "    * Online learning algorithms can be used to train models on huge datasets that cannot fit in one machine’s main memory (**Out-of-core learning**).\n",
    "        * The algorithm loads part of the data, runs a training step on that data, and repeats the process until it has run on all of the data.\n",
    "        * **Out-of-core learning** is usually done offline (i.e., not on the live system), so online learning can be a confusing name\n",
    "    * One important parameter of online learning systems is how fast they should adapt to changing data (**Learning Rate**).\n",
    "        * If you set a high learning rate, then your system will rapidly adapt to new data, but it will also tend to quickly forget the old data.\n",
    "        * if you set a low learning rate, the system will have more inertia; that is, it will learn more slowly, but it will also be less sensitive to noise in the new data or to sequences of nonrepresentative data points (outliers).\n",
    "        * A big challenge with online learning is that if bad data is fed to the system, the system’s performance will decline, possibly quickly (depending on the data quality and learning rate).\n",
    "        * To reduce this risk, you need to monitor your system closely and promptly switch learning off (and possibly revert to a previously working state) if you detect a drop in performance. You may also want to monitor the input data and react to abnormal data; for example, using an anomaly detection algorithm.\n",
