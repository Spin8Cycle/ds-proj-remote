    "    1. Optionally prenormalize the images. This leads to features that resist dependence on variations in illumination.\n",
    "    2. Convolve the image with two filters that are sensitive to horizontal and vertical brightness gradients. These capture edge, contour, and texture information.\n",
    "    3. Subdivide the image into cells of a predetermined size, and compute a histogram of the gradient orientations within each cell.\n",
    "    4. Normalize the histograms in each cell by comparing to the block of neighboring cells. This further suppresses the effect of illumination across the image.\n",
    "    5. Construct a one-dimensional feature vector from the information in each cell."
